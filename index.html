        <h2>About bioplastic</h2>
        <p>Bioplastics are biodegradable materials that come from renewable sources and can be used to reduce the problem of plastic waste that is suffocating the planet <br> and contaminating the environment. <br>
            Does it make any sense to continue using packaging that can take centuries to disappear to pack products that only last days or months?
